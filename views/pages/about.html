        <p>
            Pocket Universe it's a little app that provides brief information (like the mass and size) of some objects of the known universe.
            <br>
            <br>
            The information showed on this page comes from external sources like <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA web site</a> 
            or even sites like <a href="wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, however I'll try to keep the information up to date
            as much as possible.
            <br>
            <br>
            For now, the app status is <span class="thick-text red-text">Under Construction</span>. Once finished you can provide feedback and info to make this app better!
